                <p class="lead">EdiPhotos was started in Toronto in 2000 by owner and photographer Paco Johnson. As a photographer, Paco
                    knew of the struggles of commercializing travel photography, as well as the demand for high-quality magazine-style travel photographs.
                    He launched EdiPhotos as a small agency in Toronto, with the mission to provide premium unique photographs to high-end magazines all over
                    North America and to link exceptional photographers with mediums where their work would be appreciated.
                </p>
                <p class="lead" >Today, EdiPhotos is the go-to photo studio and agency for all high-end travel magazines worldwide, from Conde Nast to International Traveller.
                They have specialist photographers based in Asia and South America specifically, where they local knowledge and expertise allow them to 
                provide cutting-edge images on demand. EdiPhotos photographers can be commissioned to do photo shoots in multiple locations on these continents
                on client request.
